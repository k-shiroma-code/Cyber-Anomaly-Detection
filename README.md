Thesis Statement:
While intrusion detection systems such as a hybrid semi supervised ASVM and FCM model provide a passive and adaptive defense by learning to detect anomalies in network traffic, tools like T50 operate in the opposite domain as active stress testing frameworks that generate high volume multiprotocol attack traffic. Their contrasting roles of analytical defense and experimental offense not only highlight different approaches to cybersecurity but also reveal a complementary relationship in which using T50 as a controlled adversarial generator to test the resilience and adaptability of machine learning based IDS models strengthens the overall evaluation of network security systems.
